//Moving forward: try to create new salt in line with BIP-39

//Tried this line:
// const saltBuffer = Buffer.from(salt(normalize(password)), 'utf8');
//from: https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bip39/blob/master/src/index.js
//but results in error, because Buffer.from is a nodejs function: https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/met_buffer_from.asp
//produces error when saltBuffer is in our pbkdf2params object:
//const saltBuffer = Buffer.from(salt, 'utf8');

//Time to look closer at the Web Cryptography structure of a salt...

//But before that deep-dive, first, how did Ian Coleman do it?
//What? He used Buffer.from() too! How does it work in the browser for him?
//Internet: how can Buffer.from() be used in the browser?
//Stack: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56237161/how-can-i-use-node-js-buffer-library-in-client-side-javascript
//Use feross library: https://github.com/feross/buffer

//Current plan:
//Use feross library to get Buffer.from to work in browser.
//Verify that our PBKDF2 function below is now once again unbroken.
//Then, remove the feross library, and do what we need without this external library.

//If this plan is unworkable, continue forth in deep dive on salt.

//https://w3c.github.io/webcrypto/#hkdf-operations shows salt value
//clicking on "contents of" brings us here: https://w3c.github.io/webcrypto/#concept-contents-of-arraybuffer
//this informs of of an ArrayBuffer of contiguous bytes
//which is "is equal to the result of getting a copy of the bytes held data"
//which brings us here: https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#dfn-get-buffer-source-copy
//which looks like its browser level code (not javascript) fancily saying its just an ArrayBuffer of bytes.

//So how to convert our string above to an ArrayBuffer of bytes?
//stack: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6965107/converting-between-strings-and-arraybuffers
//Use TextEncoder for utf-8 encoding.
//So we try this, and PBKDF2 runs.

//Put salt in ArrayBuffer as utf-8.
const saltArrayBuffer = new TextEncoder().encode(broken_salt2);
console.log ("salty array:");
console.log (saltArrayBuffer);

const bip_39_salt = saltArrayBuffer;


//Let's try the same thing with ArrayBuffer Key.
//Use learnmeabitcoin example words for comparison of output: https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/mnemonic
const learnmewords = "punch shock entire north file identify";
const learnmewordsArrayBuffer = new TextEncoder().encode(learnmewords);
arraybufferkey = learnmewordsArrayBuffer;



//example arraybuffer used as key, not real
//var random = window.crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(16));
//arraybufferkey = random.buffer;
